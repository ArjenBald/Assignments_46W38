Task 2 â€” Word counter for text files.

Requirements covered:
- A function count_words(filename) that returns the number of words in a text file.
- Handle FileNotFoundError gracefully (return None).
- Ignore punctuation before splitting into words.
- Print the result using an f-string.

    Implementation details:
